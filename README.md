## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior data scientist with a strong foundation in data analysis using R and SQL. As I continue to grow in the field, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set by diving deeper into machine learning and Python, focusing on improving my data modeling and predictive analytics abilities.

My journey began with R and SQL, where I developed a solid understanding of data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. Using R, Iâ€™ve explored various statistical techniques and built models to draw insights from data. SQL has been essential in querying and managing large datasets, ensuring that data is organized and accessible for analysis.

Currently, Iâ€™m enhancing my skills in machine learning with Python. Iâ€™ve started working with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy to build predictive models and experiment with different algorithms. From regression and classification tasks to clustering and time-series forecasting, Iâ€™m learning how to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data problems. This repository contains some of my early work, where I focus on understanding model performance, evaluating metrics, and iterating to improve results.

One of my main goals is to gain experience in end-to-end data science projectsâ€”cleaning and preprocessing data, selecting the right models, and fine-tuning them to make reliable predictions. As I continue to learn, Iâ€™m also exploring data visualization tools, model deployment strategies, and working with cloud platforms to scale my workflows.

Thank you for checking out my projects! Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and receive feedback. Feel free to browse the code, open an issue, or connect if youâ€™re working on similar data science challenges.
